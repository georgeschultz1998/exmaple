    <h2>Left to Right, Top to Bottom*</h2>
    <p>Your HTML document should make sense when read left to right, top to bottom. This is how the browser wil read it. This is how a screen reader will read it. Visually, you can change how it looks on the page with CSS, but the HTML should be in the order that it would make sense to read.</p>
    <p>Each HTML element is considered to be inline or block. Inline elements occur within block level elements. They do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary (EXAMPLE: <a href="#">this hyperlink</a>) Whereas, block elements occupy 100% of the width available and start on a new line. (EXAMPLE: all containers and headings)</p>
    <p><em>* True for English; however, it depends on the language</em></p>

<!-- INSIDE THE SPAN TAG BELOW, ADD STYLE TO MAKE ITS FONT WEIGHT NORMAL --> 
    <h2>Note the <span>aside</span></h2>
    <p>Note that the aside container (in dark grey) is located in the HTML under the main section. This makes sense because the user is here on this webpage for the main content, but might also be interested in the content in the aside. However, visually, we can use CSS to locate this content anywhere on the page.</p>
